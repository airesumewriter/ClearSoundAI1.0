# Model Pipeline (stubs)

This folder contains placeholder/audio-processing stubs demonstrating expected inputs/outputs for ClearSound AI's audio models.

Structure:
- pipeline.py: orchestrator for the pipeline
- models/: contains example model wrappers (denoise.py, fingerprint.py)
- utils/: audio I/O and helper functions

Note: These are lightweight stubs for integration/testing. Replace with real models during AI integration phase.
